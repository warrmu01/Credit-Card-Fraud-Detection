# Credit Card Fraud Detection Machine Learning Project


## Description of the data set: 

This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

The categories for the label variable are:
● Fraudulenttransactions:Representedbythelabel"1"
● Non-fraudulenttransactions:Representedbythelabel"0"

Quantitative variables: V1 to V28 and Amount, as they represent numerical values associated with different transaction attributes.


## What problem is being solved with this dataset?

We will try to detect and prevent credit card fraud by identifying suspicious transactions based on the provided features.
